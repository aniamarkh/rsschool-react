## React. Components

### Task Description:

1. Created a separate branch for this task.
2. Used Typescript and chose to use Vite with the react-ts template to set up the project.
3. Set up eslint and prettier according to the provided configs and added a linting command to the package.json file.
4. Added React-Router version 6 and created the header, "About Us" page, and "404" page. Configured the application to redirect to the "404" page for unknown routes.
5. Implemented a search bar and cards on the main page. Used class components to access lifecycle events and state, and saved the search input value to LocalStorage during component unmount.
6. Set up Jest as the test runner and added tests for the components using React Testing Library. Added a command to the package.json file to run tests and ensured that the tests show coverage. Did not use snapshot testing in any of the modules.
