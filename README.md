# React Movie Search App 
Welcome to this unnamed React project created during the [RS School React course](https://rs.school/react/). This application allows users to search for movies using the themoviedb API. It also features a validated form page. The project is built using React, Vite, Vitest, React Redux, React Router, and React Hook Form.

## Features
- Built with React, Vite, Vitest, React Redux, React Router, and React Hook Form

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/aniamarkh/rsschool-react.git`

Change to the project directory:

`cd my-app`

Install the required dependencies:

`npm install`

Launch the development server:

`npm run dev`

## Testing
To run tests using Vitest, execute the following command:

`npm run test`

## API Key
An API key for themoviedb has already been added to the project. However, it is not a best practice to include API keys in a public repository. I apologize for this oversight, and I recommend you replace it with your own API key for security purposes. To obtain your own API key, visit [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) and follow the instructions.
